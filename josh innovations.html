    <p>C is an basic building block for every languages. It is a general Purpose Language. To develop the programming skills ‘C’ is the only platform for to develop programming techniques for any type languages. It is an Mid-level programming language for systems programming very widely used, relatively low-level, weakly typed, systems programming language associated with Unix and through that with Linux and the open source movement Performance becomes somewhat portable. Many Applications Like System Software, Application Software, Embedded Systems, Cool Games, Mobile applications, Device Drivers Programming etc of the World applications written in C and the List continues…C Designed and implemented by Dennis Ritchie 1972. Unix operating system and many of the other languages are being written in C language. C is general purpose and very powerful language. This programming language can be used in both the software and hardware programming. C language has the ability to access low-level language using height level syntax. C language is very fast and portable. C language is used to develop the Project with various domains (Telecom, Banking, Insurance, Life Science, etc). C has its own feature like the standard library. The Course is designed with basic to advance level.

    <summary>Data Structure</summary>
    <p>Data Structures is a concept a means of storing a collection of data. Computer Science is a concern with study of methods for effectively using a computer to solve problems. These can be solve by algorithms and data structures. Data Structures tells you what way the data as to store in computer memory and how to access the data efficiently. Many Applications are designed by data structures stack applications like page visited history in a web-browser, chain of method calls in the Java virtual machine or C++ Run-time environment etc Queue Application Like Waiting Lines, Multi-programming etc For many applications the choice of proper data structure is the only major decision involving the implementation. Majorly the database designing and internal implementation is done only by using Data Structures techniques.

    <summary>C#.Net</summary>
    <p>This C#.NET training teaches non-experienced people how to create the Solutions/Applications using C#.NET. C#.NET is Microsoft’s entry into the world of managed programming. Using a syntax that is deliberately from Java, C++ and C, C#.NET achieves a natural trade-off of terseness and clarity, enabling programmers to express concepts in a clear and maintainable form. The recent enhancements to the language have made it even more powerful than before, allowing programmers to work with C#.NET in both an Object-Oriented and partially functional style.

    <summary>HTML/CSS</summary>
    <p>HTML5 is everywhere, and is a technology that can no longer be ignored or treated as a mere extension of HTML4. HTML5 is a vast umbrella term for modern Front End Engineering, namely JavaScript, Markup, DeviceAPIs, and Styles. Almost anything you see in App Stores can now be created with pure HTML5. Although we will cover some of the most exciting features of HTML5 such as geo location, web sockets, local storage, Real Time Communications(Web Workers, Web Socket), File / Hardware Access(Native Drag and Drop, FileSystem APIs, Geolocation, Device Orientation and Speech Input), Semantics and Markup, Multimedia, Graphics (2D and 3D Effects) SVG and Canvas, the focus of the course will be to help people understand the core principles and best practices for creating websites and apps. CSS3 is split up into “modules”. The old specification has been split into smaller pieces, and new ones are also added. Some of the most important CSS3 modules are Selectors, Box Model, Backgrounds and Borders, Text Effects, 2D/3D Transformations, Animations, Multiple Column Layout and User Interface
